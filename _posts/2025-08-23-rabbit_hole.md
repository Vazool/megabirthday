excerpt: "Vazool recounts the origin of the megabirthday concept. And it's even more idiotic than you might imagine."

<p><strong>Megabirthday</strong> is led by <strong>Vazool</strong>.</p>

  <p>A visionary by nature, Vazool found himself tumbling down a research rabbit hole in the early 2020s, when he realised he was less than two years away from reaching the grand old age of <strong>20,000 days</strong>. Curious, he set a calendar reminder for his future self.</p>

  <p>When the day arrived, he told his colleagues.</p>

  <p>Nobody was particularly impressed.</p>

  <p>So he resolved to <em>make it a thing</em>.</p>

  <p>Since then, Vazool and team have been quietly committed to nurturing the concept, building a community of celebrants, and exploring how we might rethink timeâ€”not just as something we pass through, but as something that could <strong>celebrate us back</strong>.</p>
