excerpt: "So what exactly is the relationship between megabirthdays and common or garden birthdays. And why should we care? "

<p>The relationship between birthdays and megabirthdays interested Vazool from the start.  It started out as a kind of mathematical challenge, i.e. when might a person's birthday AND megabirthday fall upon the same day?</p>

<p>But as is so often the case, what started off as prosaic soon evolved into the poetic.  What might this convergence mean?  What might it represent, apart from a mathematical problem?*</p>

<p>Whilst the answers to these question are still not wholly clear, there is a tantalising potential for linkage with longevity research.  Now, whilst the so-called <strong>megavergence</strong> would take approximately 679 years to come about, there are some near misses en route.  For example, your 52nd birthday will miss your 19th megabirthday by just 7 days... And - currently within reach of human supercentenarians - the 42nd megabirthday misses 115th birthday by just 3 days... </p>

<p>Fascinating stuff.  Maybe human longevity should be measured in megabirthdays. Of course, I would say that. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p class="mb-footnote">* Megavergence is the first non-trivial solution to a linear Diophantine equation that equates multiples of 1000 with integer multiples of the Gregorian year cycle. Itâ€™s literally the intersection of two modular systems: the 1000-day clock and the leap-year clock.  Thatâ€™s why it lands way out at 679 years â€” thatâ€™s the first point in the Gregorian 400-year leap cycle where the arithmetic works out exactly (according to a mathematical friend.)
