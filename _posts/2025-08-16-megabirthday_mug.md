<p>When Founder, Vazool, first considered the megabirthday concept, there wasn't really a purpose as such.  It was nothing more than an interesting and playful idea; one with which to delight and more likely baffle anyone unfortunate enough to stumble across the website.</p>

<p>But over time, the concept got stickier, attaching itself to emerging opportunities.  Vazool had begun to develop an interest in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and the creative exploration of technical possibilities, more generally. Megabirthday emerged as a potential vehicle for exploring these interests; a sort of developmental playground, if you will.</p>

<p>So, in a sense, the purpose of megabirthday is to provide Vazool with a platform for learning and experimentation.  But that doesn't mean it cannot bring delight to the site's <strong>future user.</strong>  For it is also a way of sharing the joy of reaching significant milestones in life with others.  By celebrating megabirthdays, we can all take a moment to reflect on our own journeys and appreciate the passage of time.</p>

<p>The Megabirthday platform provides scope for experimentation.  In time, it will grow additional functionality from APIs to automated workflows to chatbots and possibly even e-commerce.  Megabirthday mug anyone? üòÅ</p>
