<h1>About Megabirthday.me</h1>

<p><strong>Megabirthday</strong> is a concept for marking personal growth—not by the orbit of the Earth, but by a more elegant cadence: <strong>every 1,000 days</strong>.</p>

<p>Why should our personal milestones always fall in the same season, dictated by the same tired loop around the Sun? What if there were a better rhythm—one that makes space for reflection, surprise, and a sense of time as lived?</p>

<p>At Megabirthday, we believe growth is daily, not annual—and that <strong>every 1,000 days</strong>, you’ve earned the right to celebrate.</p>

<p>A <strong>megabirthday</strong> marks each 1,000-day milestone since the day you were born. It’s an invitation to pause, take stock, and do something joyful. You're not getting older—you’re getting <em>numerically epic</em>.</p>
